🛡️ GenAI-Powered Fraud Detection API
A production-ready AI API that predicts fraud risk scores using a machine learning model (XGBoost) and generates a human-readable risk summary using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo via LangChain. Built with FastAPI.

🚀 Features
* Fraud Risk Prediction using XGBoost and SMOTE (to handle class imbalance)
* LLM-Powered Summary from GPT-3.5 Turbo via LangChain
* FastAPI Backend with clean /predict endpoint
* Swagger UI for easy API testing
* .env-based key management for OpenAI API keys

📦 Tech Stack
* Python 3.12
* FastAPI
* XGBoost
* LangChain + GPT-3.5 Turbo
* scikit-learn + pandas
* joblib
* python-dotenv

🧪 Sample API Usage
Endpoint: POST /predict
Sample Input:
{
  "amount": 1350.0,
  "location_change": 1,
  "velocity": 13.7,
  "time_of_day": 2
}
Sample Response:
{
  "fraud_score": 0.0018,
  "summary": "The transaction poses a low fraud risk based on the ML score and low velocity, despite a location change and non-typical time of day."
}

🛠️ Setup Instructions
# Clone repo and setup venv
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your OpenAI key to .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env

# Train model (optional)
jupyter notebook notebooks/train_model.ipynb

# Run API
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

🎤 1-Minute Interview Demo Script
"This is a GenAI-powered Fraud Detection API I built using FastAPI. It has a backend ML model trained with XGBoost to score the fraud risk of a transaction. On top of that, I integrated LangChain with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate a short, human-readable explanation of why a transaction is risky or not."
"The input is basic transaction features like amount, velocity, time of day, and whether the location changed. The API returns a fraud score and a contextual summary generated by the LLM."
"This project showcases my ability to build ML+LLM applications end-to-end — including model training, prompt engineering, LLM API integration, and deploying a clean, testable API with FastAPI."
